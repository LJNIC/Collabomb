# Collabomb
A sokoban-like with bombs. Instead of pushing blocks around, you push around bombs. Bombs might have a (turn-based) timer, or they might have to be detonated in a specific way. Bombs might also have different effects when they explode (think bomberman?). The goal of a level will be to blow up a specific tile with a bomb.

## Questions
* What can the player do?
* What are all of the bomb modifiers?
* Game theme? Where are we? Why are we blowing things up? Or is it abstract?
